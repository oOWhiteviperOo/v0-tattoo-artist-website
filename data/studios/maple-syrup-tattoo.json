      "Started in a tiny studio above a café on Chapel Street, Maple Syrup Tattoo has grown into Manchester's most beloved ink destination. The name came from our founder's Canadian heritage and a shared love of breakfast – but don't worry, we take our tattooing much more seriously than our morning meals.",
      "What sets us apart isn't just our perfect Google rating or our prime Salford location. It's the fact that every client leaves feeling like they've made a friend, not just gotten a tattoo. Whether you're after a delicate fine-line piece or a bold traditional design, we treat every project with the same attention to detail."

        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "What's your minimum charge?",
        "answer": "Our shop minimum is £80, which covers most small pieces and simple designs. This includes the consultation, design time, and of course the actual tattooing."
