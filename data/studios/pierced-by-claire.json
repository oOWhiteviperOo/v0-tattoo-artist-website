      "Starting as a body modification enthusiast who was frustrated by inconsistent piercing experiences around Manchester, Claire decided to create the studio she wished existed. Located right in the heart of Bridge Street, the studio reflects her no-nonsense approach: clean lines, premium equipment, and zero compromise on safety standards.",
      "Claire's philosophy is simple—every piercing should be placed with surgical precision and heal beautifully. She sources jewelry exclusively from reputable body jewelry manufacturers and maintains the highest sterilization standards. Her clients appreciate the straightforward consultation process and the fact that she'll tell you honestly if a piercing won't work for your anatomy."

        "answer": "Walk-ins are welcome, but booking ahead guarantees your slot. I can usually fit people in same-day for standard piercings, but if you want premium jewelry options or have a specific time in mind, definitely book first."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "What's included in the piercing price?",
        "answer": "All piercings include the procedure, basic jewelry, aftercare solution, and detailed healing instructions. Premium packages include upgraded jewelry options like titanium or gold pieces. No hidden costs—the price quoted is what you pay."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-3",
        "question": "How long does healing take?",
        "answer": "Depends entirely on the piercing location and your body's healing process. Earlobes are usually 6-8 weeks, cartilage can be 3-6 months. I'll give you realistic timelines during consultation and proper aftercare instructions to help things heal smoothly."
