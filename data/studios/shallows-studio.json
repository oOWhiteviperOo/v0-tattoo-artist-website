      "Started in a small corner of Manchester's Civic Quarter, Shallows Studio began as a passion project—a place where tattooing could be both an art form and a deeply personal experience. What started as one artist's vision has grown into Manchester's most trusted tattoo destination, but we've never lost that intimate, personal touch that makes each piece special.",
      "Our approach is simple: listen first, design second, tattoo third. Every client gets the same attention whether it's your first tattoo or your fiftieth. We believe great tattoos come from understanding not just what you want, but why you want it. That philosophy has earned us 480 perfect reviews and a reputation that speaks for itself."

        "question": "How far in advance do I need to book?",
        "answer": "Depends on what you're after really. For smaller pieces or touch-ups, we can often fit you in within a week. Larger custom work might need a few weeks lead time, especially if you want a specific date. Best thing is to give us a call and we'll see what we can sort out."

      {
        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "What's your deposit policy?",
        "answer": "We ask for a £50 deposit to secure your slot, which comes off your final bill. If you need to reschedule, just give us 48 hours notice and we'll move it no problem. Only time you lose the deposit is if you're a no-show, which is pretty rare to be honest."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-3",
        "question": "Do you do cover-ups and touch-ups?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Cover-ups are actually some of our favourite work—there's something satisfying about transforming an old piece into something you're proud of again. For touch-ups on work we've done, there's no charge within the first year. For other studios' work, we'll need to see it first but we're usually happy to help."
