      "We opened on Nicholas Croft in 2022 with a simple idea: Manchester deserved a tattoo studio that felt like home. No pretense, no overselling, just solid work by artists who've been doing this for years. The Northern Quarter was the obvious choice - it's always been where Manchester's creative scene thrives.",
      "Four years later, we've tattooed everyone from first-timers to heavily inked collectors. Our approach hasn't changed: listen to what you want, offer honest advice, and deliver work we're proud to put our name on. The 200+ five-star reviews speak louder than we ever could."

        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "What's your deposit policy?",
        "answer": "We ask for £50 deposit on bookings over £150, which comes off your final bill. Smaller pieces we usually don't need a deposit for. If you need to reschedule, just give us 24 hours notice and we'll move it no problem."

      {
        "id": "faq-3",
        "question": "How much will my tattoo cost?",
        "answer": "Depends on size, detail, and placement really. Small pieces start around £80, medium work is usually £100-200, and larger custom pieces can be £250+. Best thing is to come in with your idea and we'll give you an honest quote."
