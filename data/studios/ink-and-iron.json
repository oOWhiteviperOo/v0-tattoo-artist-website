        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "How do you approach custom design?",
        "answer": "I start with a consultation to understand your vision, style preferences, and placement. I create 2-3 initial concept sketches, then refine based on your feedback. You see everything before the needle touches your skin."

      {
        "id": "faq-6",
