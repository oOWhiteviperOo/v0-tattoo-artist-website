      "Rambo didn't set out to become Manchester's most talked-about tattoo artist - it just happened. What started as a small parlour in Shudehill has grown into something of a local institution, built on one simple principle: do the work right, treat people fairly, and let the tattoos speak for themselves.",
      "The studio's reputation isn't built on flashy marketing or social media hype. It's earned through years of consistent, quality work and a no-nonsense approach that cuts through the industry's pretense. Whether you're after your first piece or your fiftieth, you'll get the same honest advice and meticulous attention to detail that's made Rambo's a Shudehill staple."
