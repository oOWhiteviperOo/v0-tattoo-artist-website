      "Started in a tiny shop just off Oxford Road back in 2018, Red Sea Tattoo has grown into one of Manchester's most reliable tattoo destinations. We're not the flashiest studio in town, but we're definitely one of the most consistent. Our approach is simple: listen to what you want, create something that works with your body, and execute it with clean, solid technique.",
      "Marcus brings over a decade of tattooing experience to every piece, whether it's a quick flash design or a full custom sleeve. The studio sits right in the buzz of the city center, making us easily accessible whether you're a local or just visiting Manchester. We pride ourselves on being the kind of place where you can walk in nervous and leave feeling confident about your new ink."
